# Predicting-breast-cancer-using-an-optimized-K-Nearest-Neighbors-algorithm
I attempt to perform breast cancer prediction using the K‑Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. However, a major limitation of KNN is the need to manually determine the most suitable or optimal value of K in order to achieve the best predictive performance. The proposed method addresses this issue by automatically selecting the optimal value of K
